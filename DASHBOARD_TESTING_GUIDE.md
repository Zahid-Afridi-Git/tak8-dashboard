## 🔗 **Dashboard to Website Integration**

### **How This Will Connect to Your Actual Website:**

#### **Method 1: Database Integration (Recommended)**
```
Dashboard ↔ Database ↔ Public Website

Dashboard Updates → Database → Website Reflects Changes
```

**Implementation:**
- Dashboard saves to MongoDB/PostgreSQL
- Public website reads from same database
- Real-time sync between dashboard and website
- API endpoints handle data flow

#### **Method 2: API Integration**
```
Dashboard → API Calls → Public Website Updates
```

**Implementation:**
- Dashboard makes API calls to update website
- Website has admin API endpoints
- Changes reflect immediately on public site

#### **Method 3: Content Management System**
```
Dashboard → CMS → Website
```

**Implementation:**
- Dashboard acts as headless CMS
- Website pulls content via API
- Static site generation for performance
